# Medical Diagnosis via SEMMA Stats Framework
# Diabetes Risk Prediction: A Spontaneous Exploration with Regularized Logistic Regression

This repository documents a personal side project where I explore statistical machine learning concepts, focusing on binary classification using regularized logistic regression. The project was inspired by my desire to gain hands-on experience with the SEMMA (Sample-Explore-Modify-Model-Assess) methodology in a real-world dataset.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project comes from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Early+stage+diabetes+risk+prediction+dataset). It contains 520 observations and 17 columns, collected via direct questionnaires from patients at Sylhet Diabetes Hospital in Bangladesh. The target variable (`class`) indicates whether a patient has a positive diabetes diagnosis.

## Workflow
This side project loosely follows the SEMMA framework and involves the following steps:

### 1. Data Import
Bring the dataset into R or Python for analysis.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- ...

### 3. Variable Screening
- Explore the marginal relationships between the predictors and the target variable (`class`):
  - ...

### 4. Data Partitioning
Split dataset into sets with a 2:1 ratio.

### 5. Logistic Regression Modeling
- Train a regularized logistic regression model (e.g., LASSO) on the training data.
- ...

### 6. Model Assessment
- Evaluate the final logistic regression model on the test dataset.
- Present an ROC curve and calculate the area under the curve (AUC) to assess performance.
